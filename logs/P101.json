Want to try again or see the explanation?  \n\nHere are a few quick tips that help avoid guessing next time:\n\n- **Reread the question and the passage carefully.** Look for exact words or synonyms in the text that match the answer choices.  \n- **Underline the sentence** that seems most related to the question — if you can’t find one, the choice is probably wrong.  \n- **Use elimination.** Cross out options that go beyond what the passage says or introduce new ideas.  \n- **Watch for extreme words** (always, never, all) — they’re often wrong unless directly supported.  \n- **Ask yourself:** “Does the passage explicitly say this, or is it only implied?”\n\nWhat would you like now?\n- Try again (I’ll give a hint), or\n- Show the correct answer and a short explanation?"
