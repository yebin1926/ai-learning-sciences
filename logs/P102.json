Here are a few quick options:\n\n- **Conversation practice** (small talk, greetings)\n- **Vocabulary** (learn new words)\n- **Grammar** (short explanations + exercises)\n- **Pronunciation** (tips and examples)\n\nOr I can give you some different ways to say “hi”:\n- Formal: **Hello**, **Good morning**\n- Friendly: **Hi**, **Hey**\n- Casual: **Hey there**, **What's up?**\n- Enthusiastic: **Hi!!!**, **Hey — great to see you!**\n\nReply with one of the options or send a sentence using a greeting, and we’ll continue! 😊"

Here’s a quick breakdown and a few ways to say it differently.\n\nMeaning (simple)\n- The speaker says that when you talk specifically about food, the idea that “efficiency” is good stops being convincing — efficiency seems worse or problematic in that context.\n\nGrammar & structure\n- **But** — signals contrast with the previous idea.\n- **change the conversation to food** — means “if/when the topic becomes food.”\n- **and suddenly** — adds emphasis: the change in judgment is quick or striking.\n- **efficiency doesn’t look so good** — idiomatic: “efficiency appears less favorable.”\n\nParaphrases\n- More formal: “However, when the topic shifts to food, efficiency appears less advantageous.”\n- Simple: “If we talk about food, efficiency starts to look bad.”\n- Neutral: “When we focus on food, efficiency seems problematic.”\n\nVocabulary alternatives\n- suddenly → abruptly, immediately, notably\n- doesn’t look so good → appears less favorable, seems problematic, is called into question\n\nWant to practice? I can:\n- give a short exercise to rewrite the sentence in different tones, or\n- explain how this change affects the argument in a paragraph."

The passage is focused on increasing production from the land already under cultivation, not on whatever idea you gave.\n\n**Why the correct answer is correct**\n- The passage emphasizes raising agricultural productivity per unit area (more output from cultivated land) through methods, improvements, or intensification. That directly supports **\"maximize the output of cultivated land.\"**\n\nNow, please explain in your own words **why \"maximize the output of cultivated land.\"** is the correct answer based on the explanation above."

Look for keywords that imply protection: **protect / preserve / conserve / spare / reduce conversion / leave land uncultivated** or cause-and-effect phrasing (e.g., “so that” / “thereby” / “which means”).  \n3. Copy the exact word or short phrase from the line and then explain in one sentence why that wording supports “protects wildlife habitats” (connect the phrase to the idea of reducing habitat loss or preserving land).\n\nIf you want, paste line 27 here and I’ll help you pick the exact phrase and write the supporting explanation. You’re doing well — this is exactly the kind of skill that gets easier with practice!"
